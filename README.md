Hook scripts to integrate &amp; sync task libraries between Todoist &amp; Taskwarrior

VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.

These hook scripts will manage keeping your Todoist and Taskwarrior task libraries synced.

Features:
  - Automatically install with install.py
  - Push newly created Taskwarrior tasks to Todoist
    - Also push projects: create on Todoist if it doesn't exist or add it to the task "Inbox" if none was specified.
